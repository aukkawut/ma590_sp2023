# Problem 1

Imagine an experiment in which a group of smokers is randomized between two groups: 
one is encouraged to quit smoking, and the other is not. A year later, subjects in both treatment 
arms complete a survey asking whether they are still smoking, and they undergo a medical 
examination to determine the health of their lungs. In this case, receiving the treatment 
$W =1$ if they quit smoking and $W=0$ if they did not. The health of their lungs is the outcome of interest, $Y$. 
Describe possible violations of the three instrumental variable assumptions. 

# Problem 2
If $A, B$, and $C$ are random variables, with $A$ binary, show that 
$$\frac{\text{cov}(A,B)}{\text{cov}(A,C)} = \frac{\mathbb{E}[B|A=1]-\mathbb{E}[B|A=0]}{\mathbb{E}[C|A=1]-\mathbb{E}[C|A=0]}$$
You may use the fact that for any two random variables $x$ and $y$, $\text{cov}(x,y) = \mathbb{E}[xy] - \mathbb{E}[x]\mathbb{E}[y]$ 

# Problem 3
In a randomized trial within a piece of educational software, one random group of student working on a particular 
math problem are given the option of pushing a button that says "show explanation" that will show them a paragraph 
explaining how to do the problem, while another group are given the option of pushing on a button that says 
"show video" that includes a video of a teacher explaining the concepts behind the problem. 
The outcome of interest is students' performance on the next problem. 
In both conditions, students may solve the problem without requesting any help. Let $Z_i=1$ if student $i$ is 
assigned to an explanation and $Z_i=0$ if $i$ is assigned to the video condition. Let $W_i=1$ if student $i$ 
requested help (be it an explanation or a video, depending on $Z_i$) and 0 otherwise.

## Part A
What are the principal strata (groups defined based on $w(0)$ and $w(1)$) in this problem?

## Part B
What would be wrong with estimating average treatment effects using data from only students who 
requested help by pushing on either the explanation or video button? In what circumstances would this be 
justifiable?

## Part C
Assume monotonicity, i.e. $w(1) \geq w(0)$. Give an estimate based on observed $Z$ and $W$ for the proportion 
of the dataset belonging to each of the four principal strata.
